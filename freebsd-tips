FreeBSD is started up by the program 'init'.  The first thing init does when
starting multiuser mode (ie, starting the computer up for normal use) is to
run the shell script /etc/rc.  By reading /etc/rc and the /etc/rc.d/ scripts,
you can learn a lot about how the system is put together, which again will
make you more confident about what happens when you do something with it.

If you have a CD-ROM drive in your machine, you can make the CD-ROM that is
presently inserted available by typing 'mount /cdrom' as root.  The CD-ROM
will be available under /cdrom/.  Remember to do 'umount /cdrom' before
removing the CD-ROM (it will usually not be possible to remove the CD-ROM
without doing this.)

Note: This tip may not work in all configurations.

If you want df(1) and other commands to display disk sizes in
kilobytes instead of 512-byte blocks, set BLOCKSIZE in your
environment to 'K'.  You can also use 'M' for Megabytes or 'G' for
Gigabytes.  If you want df(1) to automatically select the best size
then use 'df -h'.

the environment variable HTTP_AUTH to 'basic:*'.
%
In order to search for a string in some files, use 'grep' like this:

	 grep "string" filename1 [filename2 filename3 ...]

This will print out the lines in the files that contain the string.  grep can
also do a lot more advanced searches - type 'man grep' for details.
%
In order to support national characters for European languages in tools like

``set -o emacs'' or ``set -o vi'' to enable it. Use "<TAB>" key to complete
paths.
%
Simple tcsh prompt: set prompt = '%# '
%
The default editor in FreeBSD is vi, which is efficient to use when you have
learned it, but somewhat user-unfriendly.  To use ee (an easier but less
powerful editor) instead, set the environment variable EDITOR to /usr/bin/ee
%

To determine whether a file is a text file, executable, or some other type
of file, use

	file filename
		-- Dru <genesis@istar.ca>
%
To do a fast search for a file, try

	 locate filename

locate uses a database that is updated every Saturday (assuming your computer

		-- Dru <genesis@istar.ca>
%
To find out the hostname associated with an IP address, use

	drill -x IP_address
		-- Dru <genesis@istar.ca>
%
To obtain a neat PostScript rendering of a manual page, use ``-t'' switch
of the man(1) utility: ``man -t <topic>''.  For example:

	man -t grep > grep.ps	# Save the PostScript version to a file
or
	man -t printf | lp	# Send the PostScript directly to printer
%
To quickly create an empty file, use "touch filename".
		-- Dru <genesis@istar.ca>
%
To read a compressed file without having to first uncompress it, use
"zcat" or "zless" to view it. There is also "bzcat", "bzless", "xzcat"
and "xzless".
		-- Dru <genesis@istar.ca>
%
To save disk space in your home directory, compress files you rarely
use with "gzip filename".
		-- Dru <genesis@istar.ca>
%
To search for files that match a particular name, use find(1); for example

	find / -name "*GENERIC*" -ls

will search '/', and all subdirectories, for files with 'GENERIC' in the name.
      	--  Stephen Hilton <nospam@hiltonbsd.com>
%
To see all of the directories on your FreeBSD system, type

	find / -type d | less

All the files?

	find / -type f | less
%
To see how long it takes a command to run, type the word "time" before the
command name.
		-- Dru <genesis@istar.ca>
%
To see how much disk space is left on your UFS partitions, use

	df -h
		-- Dru <genesis@istar.ca>
%
To see the 10 largest files in a directory or on a UFS partition, use

	du -h /partition_or_directory_name | sort -rh | head
		-- Dru <genesis@istar.ca>
%
To see the IP addresses currently set on your active interfaces, type
"ifconfig -u".
		-- Dru <genesis@istar.ca>
%
To see the last 10 lines of a long file, use "tail filename". To see the
first 10 lines, use "head filename". To see new lines as they're appended
to a file, use "tail -f filename".
		-- Dru <genesis@istar.ca>
%
To see the last time that you logged in, use lastlogin(8).
		-- Dru <genesis@istar.ca>
%
To see the MAC addresses of the NICs on your system, type

	ifconfig -a
		-- Dru <genesis@istar.ca>
%
To see the output from when your computer started, run dmesg(8).  If it has
been replaced with other messages, look at /var/run/dmesg.boot.
		-- Francisco Reyes <lists@natserv.com>
%
Want colour in your directory listings?  Use "ls -G".  "ls -F" is also useful,
and they can be combined as "ls -FG".
%
Want to find a specific port? Just type the following under /usr/ports
or one of its subdirectories:

	make search name=<port-name>
    or
	make search key=<keyword>
%
Want to know how many words, lines, or bytes are contained in a file? Type
"wc filename".
		-- Dru <genesis@istar.ca>
%
Want to see how much virtual memory you're using? Just type "swapinfo" to
be shown information about the usage of your swap partitions.
%
Want to strip UTF-8 BOM(Byte Order Mark) from given files?

	sed -e '1s/^\xef\xbb\xbf//' < bomfile > newfile
%
Want to use sed(1) to edit a file in place?  Well, to replace every 'e' with
an 'o', in a file named 'foo', you can do:

	sed -i.bak s/e/o/g foo

And you'll get a backup of the original in a file named 'foo.bak', but if you
want no backup:

	sed -i '' s/e/o/g foo
%
When you've made modifications to a file in vi(1) and then find that
you can't write it, type ``<ESC>!rm -f %'' then ``:w!'' to force the
write

This won't work if you don't have write permissions to the directory
and probably won't be suitable if you're editing through a symbolic link.

If you have sudo(8) installed and permissions to use it, type 
``<ESC>w ! sudo tee %'' to force a write.
%
You can adjust the volume of various parts of the sound system in your
computer by typing 'mixer <type> <volume>'.  To get a list of what you can
adjust, just type 'mixer'.
%
You can automatically download and install binary packages by doing

	pkg install <package>

This will also automatically install the packages that are dependencies
for the package you install (ie, the packages it needs in order to work.)
%
You can change the video mode on all consoles by adding something like
the following to /etc/rc.conf:

	allscreens="80x30"

You can use "vidcontrol -i mode | grep T" for a list of supported text
modes.
		-- Konstantinos Konstantinidis <kkonstan@duth.gr>
%
You can disable tcsh's terminal beep if you `set nobeep'.
%
You can install extra packages for FreeBSD by using the ports system.
If you have installed it, you can download, compile, and install software by
just typing

	# cd /usr/ports/<category>/<portname>
	# make install && make clean

as root.  The ports infrastructure will download the software, change it so
it works on FreeBSD, compile it, install it, register the installation so it
will be possible to automatically uninstall it, and clean out the temporary
working space it used.  You can remove an installed port you decide you do not
want after all by typing

	# cd /usr/ports/<category>/<portname>
	# make deinstall

as root.
%
You can look through a file in a nice text-based interface by typing

	less filename
%
You can make a log of your terminal session with script(1).
%
You can often get answers to your questions about FreeBSD by searching in the
FreeBSD mailing list archives at

	http://freebsd.markmail.org
%
You can open up a new split-screen window in (n)vi with :N or :E and then
use ^w to switch between the two.
%
You can permanently set environment variables for your shell by putting them
in a startup file for the shell.  The name of the startup file varies
depending on the shell - csh and tcsh uses .login, bash, sh, ksh and zsh use
.profile.  When using bash, sh, ksh or zsh, don't forget to export the
variable.
%
You can press Ctrl-D to quickly exit from a shell, or logout from a
login shell.
		-- Konstantinos Konstantinidis <kkonstan@duth.gr>
%
You can press up-arrow or down-arrow to walk through a list of
previous commands in tcsh.
%
You can search for documentation on a keyword by typing

	apropos keyword
%
You can `set autologout = 30' to have tcsh log you off automatically
if you leave the shell idle for more than 30 minutes.
%
You can use aliases to decrease the amount of typing you need to do to get
commands you commonly use.  Examples of fairly popular aliases include (in
Bourne shell style, as in /bin/sh, bash, ksh, and zsh):

	alias lf="ls -FA"
	alias ll="ls -lA"
	alias su="su -m"

In csh or tcsh, these would be

	alias lf ls -FA
	alias ll ls -lA
	alias su su -m

To remove an alias, you can usually use 'unalias aliasname'.  To list all
aliases, you can usually type just 'alias'.
%
You can use /etc/make.conf to control the options used to compile software
on this system.  Example entries are in
/usr/share/examples/etc/make.conf and in make.conf(5).
For options that are set for building FreeBSD's kernel and its world, see
src.conf(5).
%
You can use "pkg info" to see a list of packages you have installed.
%
You can use the 'fetch' command to retrieve files over ftp, http or https.

	 fetch https://www.FreeBSD.org/index.html

will download the front page of the FreeBSD web site.
%
You can use "whereis" to search standard binary, manual page and source
directories for the specified programs. This can be particularly handy
when you are trying to find where in the ports tree an application is.

Try "whereis firefox" and "whereis whereis".
		-- Konstantinos Konstantinidis <kkonstan@duth.gr>
%
Want to run the same command again?
In many shells (e.g., tcsh, zsh, bash) you can type "!!".
%
Want to go the directory you were just in?
Type "cd -"
%
Can't delete /usr/obj? Enter "chflags -R noschg /usr/obj" to remove the
system immutable flag for all files in /usr/obj.

%
If you want to recursively copy a directory preserving file and directory
attributes use
"cp -a source target"

		-- Lars Engels <lme@FreeBSD.org>
%
Do you wonder what a terminal program is doing at the moment? dd(1) does not
show any throughput? Hit "^T" (Control + t) to send SIGINFO to the process
and see what it is doing.

		-- Lars Engels <lme@FreeBSD.org>
%
Do you want to know which version of FreeBSD you are running? Enter
"freebsd-version -ku" to display kernel and userland version.

		-- Lars Engels <lme@FreeBSD.org>
%
If you want to end one or more processes at a time using a regular expression
enter "pkill regex".

		-- Lars Engels <lme@FreeBSD.org>
%
Do you want to run a program directly after some other process has ended? Use
"pwait pid && new_program"

		-- Lars Engels <lme@FreeBSD.org>
%
When you want your users to be able to reboot or shutdown FreeBSD, add them
to the group "operator" and they are allowed to use shutdown(8) and poweroff(8).

		-- Lars Engels <lme@FreeBSD.org>
%
If you need to create a FAT32 formatted USB thumb drive, find out its devicename
running dmesg(8) after inserting it. Then create an MBR schema, a single slice and
format it:

# gpart create -s MBR ${devicename}
# gpart add -t fat32 ${devicename}
# newfs_msdos -F 32 -L thumbdrive ${devicename}s1

		-- Lars Engels <lme@FreeBSD.org>
%
If you want to get a sorted list of all services that are started when FreeBSD boots,
enter "service -e".

		-- Lars Engels <lme@FreeBSD.org>
%
To easily configure your installed FreeBSD use bsdconfig(8).

		-- Lars Engels <lme@FreeBSD.org>
%
After you compiled and installed a new version of FreeBSD, use etcupdate(8) to merge
configuration updates.
Run "etcupdate extract" once when your sources match your running system, then run
"etcupdate" after every upgrade and "etcupdate resolve" to resolve any conflicts.

		-- Lars Engels <lme@FreeBSD.org>
%
Do you want to do a binary upgrade of your running FreeBSD installation? Use freebsd-update(8).

To install updates and patches for the running branch use
# freebsd-update fetch install

To upgrade to a newer release use
# freebsd-update upgrade -r ${name_of_release}

		-- Lars Engels <lme@FreeBSD.org>
%
To run rc scripts in /etc/rc.d and /usr/local/etc/rc.d use service(8).
Run "service ${name_of_rc_script} start" to start a daemon and
"service ${name_of_rc_script} stop" to stop it.

		-- Lars Engels <lme@FreeBSD.org>
%
If you don't want to edit /etc/rc.conf directly, use sysrc(8) to add and remove entries.
Use "sysrc name=value" to add an entry and "sysrc -x name" to delete an entry.

		-- Lars Engels <lme@FreeBSD.org>
%
You can upload the dmesg of your system to help developers get an overview of commonly
used hardware and peripherals for FreeBSD. Use the curl package to upload it like this:
curl -v -d "nickname=$USER" -d "description=FreeBSD/$(uname -m) on \
$(kenv smbios.system.maker) $(kenv smbios.system.product)" -d "do=addd" \
--data-urlencode 'dmesg@/var/run/dmesg.boot' http://dmesgd.nycbug.org/index.cgi
%
Want to know how much memory (in bytes) your machine has installed? Let
sysctl(8) tell you with the following command:

sysctl hw.realmem

The realmem value is memory before the kernel and modules are loaded, whereas
hw.physmem is what is left after they were loaded. 

The number of active CPUs is displayed using this command:

sysctl hw.ncpu

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
When using ZFS as the file system the "df" command is reporting the pool size
and not file system sizes. It also does not know about descendent ZFS
datasets, snapshots, quotas, and reservations with their individual space usage. 
Use the built-in "zfs list" command to get a better overview of space usage:

zfs list -o space

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
To learn more about what your system is doing, take a look at systat(1). For
example, to get various of statistics related to virtual memory usage, process
scheduling, device interrupts, system name translation caching, and disk I/O,
enter the following:

systat -vmstat

Other values are icmp, icmp6, ifstat, iostat, ip, ip6, netstat, pigs, sctp,
swap, tcp, or zarc. You can switch between displays using :<display> and exit
back to your shell by typing

:quit

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
To set a quota of 10 GB for the user named foo on a ZFS dataset, run the
following command:

# zfs set userquota@foo=10G pool/home/foo

The zfs userspace command can display the quota and current space usage:

# zfs userspace pool/home/foo

To unset a quota, assign "none" as the value. 
		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
ZFS can display I/O statistics for a given pool using the iostat subcommand.
By default, it will display one line of current activity.  To display stats
every 5 seconds run the following command (cancel with CTRL+C):

zpool iostat 5

To view individual disk activities, specify the -v parameter:

zpool iostat -v

Of course, both can be combined. For more options, see zpool(8).
		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
FreeBSD's top(1) utility displays CPU statistics by default.
To display I/O activity for each process instead, run top like this:

top -m io

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
ZFS keeps a history of commands run against a specific pool using the
history subcommand to zpool:

zpool history

More details are available using the -i and -l parameters. Note that ZFS
will not keep the complete pool history forever and will remove older
events in favor of never ones.
		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
To display the compression ratio for the ZFS dataset /var/log on the pool
mypool, run the following command:

zfs get refcompressratio mypool/var/log

The refcompressratio will only display the compression ratio for that specific
dataset, not the descendant datasets. To include the child datasets, the
command looks like this:

zfs get compressratio mypool/var

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
You can limit the depth of the displayed datasets in the "zfs list" output
using the -d parameter. To display only the first level of datasets below
mypool/usr and not the ones deeper than those, run this command:

zfs list -d 1 mypool/usr

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
The "zfs list" command can be filtered in multiple ways. To display just
the dataset name, use the -o parameter:

zfs list -o name mypool/usr

More columns and their order can be defined by separating them with commas:

zfs list -o mountpoint,name,avail

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
The output of "zfs list" can be sorted by a specific column using -s.  To
sort the datasets by the "used" column in ascending order, run this command:

zfs list -s used

To sort in descending order instead, use -S:

zfs list -S used

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
To make the "zfs list" output more script-friendly, you can suppress the
output of the headers for each column by passing the -H parameter:

zfs list -H

Another helpful option for script writers is -p, which displays the numbers
in non-rounded, exact values:

zfs list -p 

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
Before deleting a dataset or snapshot, perform a dry run using the -n
parameter. This is to make sure you really want to delete just that
dataset/snapshot and not any dependent ones. ZFS will display the resulting
action when -n is combined with the -v option without actually performing
it:

zfs destroy -nrv mypool@mysnap

Once you are sure this is exactly what you intend to do, remove the -n
parameter to execute the destroy operation.
		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
You can delete a range of ZFS snapshots (a-z) in multiple ways.
The following will delete d and all earlier snapshots: 

zfs destroy mypool/data@%d

To delete d and all later snapshots:

zfs destroy mypool/data@d%

To delete all dataset snapshots:

zfs destroy mypool/data@%

Make sure to let ZFS perform a dry run (-n option) first and display (-v) what
it would do to confirm that the delete operation is removing exactly what you 
intended. 
		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
To set a custom ZFS property on the mypool pool, you need to provide it
using the "key1:key2=value" syntax, where the colon (:) is used as the
separator and identifier from the built-in ZFS properties:

# zfs set warranty:expires=2038-01-19 mypool

The custom property is applied to all datasets and can be queried like any
built-in properties using zfs get:

zfs get warranty:expires mypool

To reset the value of a custom property, use the inherit subcommand:

# zfs inherit warranty:expires mypool

Removing a custom property from a pool is done using the -r flag to the
"zfs inherit" command:

# zfs inherit -r warranty:expires mypool

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
To delete a range of ZFS snapshots, use the % (percent) character after the
full path to the first snapshot that should be included. For example, to
simulate deleting snapshots a through (including) d, use this command:

# zfs destroy -rvn mypool/tmp@a%d

Once you are sure that this is what you want, remove the -n option:

# zfs destroy -rv mypool/tmp@a%d

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>

You can prevent the removal of a ZFS snapshot by using the hold subcommand.
For example, to prevent the snapshot called milestone from deletion, run the
following command:

# zfs hold milestone_hold mypool/projects@my_milestone

The "zfs holds" command will list all current snapshots that are protected
this way (-r for a recursive list):

# zfs holds -r mypool

The TIMESTAMP column in the output of the above command is from when the
hold was created, not the snapshot it holds. The "zfs destroy" command will
echo a "dataset is busy" message on the console when it encounters a hold.
Use "zfs release" to release the hold on the snapshot:

# zfs release milestone_hold mypool/projects@my_milestone

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
A user "sender" needs the following permissions set to send a ZFS dataset:

# zfs allow -u sender send,snapshot txpool

On the receiving side, the user "receiver" requires these permissions:

# zfs allow -u receiver compression,mountpoint,mount,create,receive rxpool

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
Don't let your zpool fill up completely by creating a dataset with
reservation.

# zfs create -o refreservation=<5% of total pool space> <poolname>/reserved

You can always shrink the reserve if you need the space, but your pool will
always have space left this way.

Debian Hint #1: You can report a bug in a package with the 'reportbug' command,
which is available in the reportbug package, either from the command-line or
with the new graphical frontend (available running 'reportbug --ui gtk2' or in
the menu).
%
Debian Hint #2: You can use 'dpkg-reconfigure <package>' to change the
answers you gave to the questions asked when you first installed a package.
The 'configure-debian' package provides a unified front end for doing this,
as well.
%
Debian Hint #3: You can use either 'apt search <words>' or
'aptitude search <words>' to search for words in the descriptions of all
available packages.
%
Debian Hint #4: You can see the available and installed versions for one
or more available packages with the command 'apt policy <packages>'.
%
Debian Hint #5: If you need to build a custom kernel, use the 'make-kpkg'
script found in the kernel-package package.
%
Debian Hint #6: There is no hint #6. Submit a hint today!
%
Debian Hint #7: You can use the unattended-upgrades or cron-apt packages
to do automatic nightly downloads of updates for packages installed on
your system.
%
Debian Hint #8: If you have problems with Debian that you can't solve by
reading the manuals and documentation, try asking on the Debian Users
mailing list (debian-user@lists.debian.org).
%
Debian Hint #9: If you need to know what version of Debian you're currently
running, look in /etc/debian_version or use 'lsb_release -sc' command. If you
want to know the codename for that version (for example, 5.0 is codenamed
'Lenny'), check this URL:

https://www.debian.org/doc/FAQ/ch-ftparchives.html#s-codenames
%
Debian Hint #10: There are Debian mailing lists for everything from user
questions to debates over what to put into the Debian Policy documents.
Check out the list at https://www.debian.org/MailingLists/ and subscribe to
those that interest you.
%
Debian Hint #11: Keep up to date on what's going on - read the Debian
Project News. Read it on the web at https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/
%
Debian Hint #12: The grep-dctrl package provides a number of useful scripts
for quickly searching various package control files (such as the available
packages file).
%
Debian Hint #13: If you don't like the default options used in a Debian
package, you can download the source and build a version which uses the
options you prefer. See https://www.debian.org/doc/FAQ/ch-pkg_basics.html
(sections 6.13 and 6.14) for more information.

However, bear in mind that most options in most packages can be configured
at runtime, and do not require recompiling the package.
%
Debian Hint #14: If you would like to follow things happening to a package
(for example, if you want to see bug reports, release notices, and other
similar things), consider subscribing to it on the Debian Package Tracker.
You can find out more about the Debian Package Tracker at:

https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/ch04.en.html#pkg-tracker
%
Debian Hint #15: The documentation for a package can normally be found
under /usr/share/doc/<package>. In particular, the README.Debian file often
has useful information about Debian-specific quirks or tips.
%
Debian Hint #16: If you're searching for a particular file, but don't know
which package it belongs to, try installing 'apt-file', which maintains a
small database of this information, or search the contents of the Debian
Packages database, which can be done at:

https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_contents
%
Debian Hint #17: Need someone to talk to about Debian? If you're comfortable
with Internet Relay Chat (IRC), just install your favorite IRC client, and
join #debian on irc.debian.org.
%
Debian Hint #18: Quality control information about a package can be found by
going to https://tracker.debian.org/<package>; this page provides links to the
Maintainer's QA page, the BTS, news items for the package, and information on
which versions are available in which archives.
%
Debian Hint #19: If you're interested in building packages from source, you
should consider installing the apt-src package.
%
Debian Hint #20: Want to keep track of what version of a package you have
installed (especially useful for those running hybrid stable / testing /
unstable systems)? Check out apt-show-versions.
%
Debian Hint #21: If your Debian box is behind a slow network connection,
but you have access to a fast one as well, check out the apt-zip package.
%
Debian Hint #22: Wondering which Debian mirror is best for you? Check out
the apt-spy and netselect-apt packages, which can give you information
about how various mirror sites perform.
%
Debian Hint #23: If your system is using too much disk space, try the
deborphan package; it can offer suggestions about which packages may be
unused and removable. And, of course, don't forget to clean out the
APT cache area (using 'apt clean', 'aptitude clean', or
aptitude's Action -> Clean package cache menu item).
%
Debian Hint #24: If you would like to thank a maintainer for handling an
issue, check out reportbug --kudos.
%
Debian Hint #25: The 'debian-reference' package contains a wide variety
of reference documents for Debian users and developers. Most of the
information can also be found at the following URL:

https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/reference
%
Debian Hint #26: If a package doesn't seem to have much documentation,
check for a package named '<package>-doc' or similar and make sure to
install it as well; packages with large amounts of documentation
regularly split the docs in this manner for those who don't want to
install them.
%
Debian Hint #27: Regularly verify your backups. You *are* keeping backups,
right? Right? If not, start with tar(1) or dump(1).
%
Debian Hint #28: If your machine is not on all of the time (such as a
laptop), check out the 'anacron' package; this will make sure that regular
tasks still happen, even if the machine isn't on at the time they would
normally trigger.
%
Debian Hint #29: Keep your system clock accurate - Machines which are turned on
most or all of the time should have the 'ntp' package installed to keep the time
accurate in between reboots.
%
Debian Hint #30: Documentation can be made available at http://localhost/
by installing the 'doc-base' and 'doc-central' packages and their
dependencies.
%
Debian Hint #31: In sysvinit, disabling a normally-active service in a
specific runlevel should be done by changing the S link in /etc/rc<level>.d
to a K link, rather than removing the link entirely; if all links are removed,
the system will assume on the next install that they need to be replaced. You
can achieve this with 'update-rc.d <service> disable|enable [<runlevel>]'.
%
Debian Hint #32: The package 'doc-debian' contains some general
documentation about the Debian project. It is also available in Spanish
(doc-debian-es), French (doc-debian-fr) and Ukrainian (doc-debian-uk).
%
Debian Hint #33: The package 'devscripts' contains some useful scripts for
users who want to help to improve Debian, e.g. wnpp-alert, rc-alert and bts.
%
Debian Hint #34: If you want to track Debian sid and have a small download
quota or a really slow connection, check out the debdelta package.
%
Debian Hint #35: In search for some games? Take a look at 'goplay', which
offers a nice frontend for browsing through all kind of games.
%
Debian Hint #36: Need a newer package than shipped with Debian's last
stable release, but don't want to upgrade to 'testing' or 'unstable'? Some
packages are kept up-to-date via the stable-updates suite, some others are
made available via the stable-backports suite.
%
Debian Hint #37: Want to download a package without installing it? Use
'apt download <pkgname>' or 'aptitude download <pkgname>'.
%
Debian Hint #38: Want to know how you can use a program you have never used
before? "man" will be your best new friend! Type "man <program-name>" in a
shell. Run "man -H <program-name>" to read the manual page in a browser. Or,
point your browser to "https://manpages.debian.org/<program-name>".
%
Debian Hint #39: Improve bash's tab-completion by installing the
bash-completion package.
%
Debian Hint #40: If you install the command-not-found package, attempting to
run a command you don't have installed will tell you what package to install to
obtain that command.
%
Debian Hint #41: You can use 'apt show <package_name>' or 'aptitude show
<package_name>' to get more information about a debian package.
%
Debian Hint #42: You can use 'apt-file list <package_name>' to obtain a listing
of the contents of debian package. This action is similar to
'dpkg -L <package_name>' except the package does not need to be installed or
fetched using apt and analyzed with 'dpkg-deb -c <deb_name>'.
%
Debian Hint #43: Want to temporarily disable your iptables firewall? Use
'iptables-save | sed "/-/d;/^#/d;s/DROP/ACCEPT/" | iptables-restore' to remove
all rules and set the default policy to ACCEPT.
%
Debian Hint #44: You can follow the Identi.ca account for Debian at
https://identi.ca/debian More information of Debian at Identica can also
be found at: https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Publicity/Identica

Your KVM powered virtual machines will do IOs up to seven times faster if
you enable virtio. http://tinyurl.com/virtio
%
The Ubuntu Server Team is an open community always looking for feedback and
help: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server
%
Did you know that releases of Ubuntu labeled LTS are maintained for 5 years
on servers? 'cat /etc/lsb-release' will tell you which release you are on.
%
Browse the command line history with ctrl-r and then type a few characters
that you know are part of the command you are looking for.
%
Edit the command line with cut and paste: ctrl-k for cut, and ctrl-y for
paste.
%
Reach the end-of-line with ctrl-e and the beginning of line with ctrl-a.
%
Instead of typing the user and group, if they are the same (like for
www-data)  you can just type the user followed by a colon: 'sudo chown -R
www-data: *'
%
Use the "which" command to find if an executable is in your path, and if it
is, where you can find the file. e.g. 'which nano'
%
Instead of typing exit or closing the terminal if you want to logout you can
press Ctrl+D.
%
Use 'tail -f file' to watch a log file as messages get appended, and use
'tail -100 file' to change the count of lines read from the file.
%
An easy way to see what processes own which network connections: 'sudo
netstat -tup' for connections and 'sudo netstat -tupl for listening process.
%
The 'history' command will show you the commands you've used before.
Alternatively you can use the up arrow button to look through them.
%
To make a backup without typing the full path twice: 'cp
/long/path/to/file/name{,.orig}' to create a copy with the suffix .orig
%
If you executed a command and neglected to use sudo, you can execute "sudo
!!" to re-execute the previous command with sudo prepended.
%
Install 'denyhosts' to help protect against brute force SSH attacks,
auto-blocking multiple attempts.
%
Use "iotop" for measuring hard disk I/O (current read/write) usage per
application.
%
If you are using a PostgreSQL database, use "ptop" to monitor real time
usage.
%
Use "iftop" to monitor current network activity connections per host.
%
Use "pastebinit" to copy a file, or output of a command to a webpage
allowing you to share it. e.g. 'pastebinit /proc/cpuinfo' or 'df -h |
pastebinit'
%
Use "tail -f /var/log/some.log" to see new lines added to a log instantly in
real time.  Ideal for watching webserver requests as they happen.
%
Save time starting to type a command or file name, then press tab to
complete Hit tab twice to bring up multiple completion options.
%
Append your ssh key to your server's authorized keys file using the command
'ssh-copy-id user@server_address'
%
If you want to download a file from a URL via the console, you can use the
command 'wget http://address/to/file.tar'
